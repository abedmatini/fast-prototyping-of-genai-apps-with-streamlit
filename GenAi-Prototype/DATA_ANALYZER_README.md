- **Negative**: Reviews expressing dissatisfaction, complaints, or negative experiences
- **Neutral**: Reviews that are factual, balanced, or lack strong emotional indicators

### Chart Interpretation

#### **Traditional Charts**:

- **Lower bars** in sentiment score chart = products with more negative feedback
- **Higher bars** = products with better customer satisfaction

#### **AI Sentiment Charts**:

- **Red bars (Negative)**: Count of reviews classified as negative by Gemini AI
