## Plan Your MVP: Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Describe Your App Idea**
	- Write a one or two sentence description of your general app idea.

2. **Use a Generic AI Tool**
	- Use your favorite generic tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to brainstorm and refine your idea.

3. **Copy-Paste the Structure Prompt**
	- Use a structured prompt like this example:
     
	  > "Act as a product manager. Help me define the MVP for a generic app using these principles: define the end goal, identify the audience, choose success metrics, and prioritize core features. Walk me through each step: What problem are you solving? Who are you solving it for? What would success look like? What are the must-have features?"

4. **Ask for Help Defining Your MVP**
	- Ask the AI for help in defining your MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

5. **Categorize Your Features**
	- Categorize your features as either:
	  - Must Have
	  - Nice to Have
	  - Next Version

6. **Stretch Goal: Competitive Analysis**
	- Ask the AI to run a quick competitive analysis of similar apps or solutions.

7. **Document Your Plan**
	- Summarize your plan as a one-page document.
